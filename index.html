                <p>Blockchain is an emerging, disruptive, general-purpose, foundational and buzzy technology that is
                    drawing a lot of attention from academia, industry, business, and the general population. The
                    Blockchain Investigation Group at the University of Houston-Clear Lake (BIG@UHCL) is a research
                    group of computing faculty members and students. It collaborates with partner organizations on
                    blockchain projects and conduct related research. BIG@UHCL focuses on domain-specific Consortium
                    Blockchain Applications (CBA) using permissioned blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger’s
                    Fabric.<br><br>The team is especially interested in the following issues related to CBA:<br><br>

                </br>Currently, BIG@UHCL focus on two domain areas:<br>
                <br> 1.Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): constructing effective CBA for MBSE’s Single Source of
                Truth (SST) repositories for systems engineering consortium.
                <br>2.Healthcare: investigating the applications of blockchains on effectively storing specific kinds of

                    “Our proposed concept is to use Blockchain Technology (BCT) to enhance the Model Based Systems
                    Engineering (MBSE) team collaboration. Blockchains are a highly tamper-resistant Distributed Ledger
                    Technology (DLT) in which all relevant transactions are immutably and identically recorded and
                    stored in
                    nodes of distributed networks to provide an authoritative Single Source of Truth (SST). Blockchains
                    also
                    support decentralized governance with nuanced privacy models. Smart Contracts (SC) are
                    self-enforcing
                    agreements realized by the automatic execution of agreed-upon computer code upon the endorsement of
                    transactions between multiple parties. The benefits of our concept are SST, high security, improved
                    trust, privacy preservation, transparency, accountability, traceability, and high cost
                    effectiveness.
                    The goal of our proposed concept is to provide the NASA MBSE teams with BCT tools to share models
                    and
                    implement collaborative processes in a secure, decentralized, and distributive environment.”<br><br>

                Fall 2021<br> 1. Secure Full-Stack Web Application for Consortium Blockchain<br> <p>Abstract: The project aims to design and build a full-stack web client for blockchain interactions and tosatisfy modern and more detailed requirements. Implementing a Role-based login authentication for the users to access the web client application. By using Angular 13 and Express Web server we authenticate the user and navigate to the dashboard. Organizations have different roles, and different roles have different access to the MBSE Assets and implementation of MBSE asset management with creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations and functionality supporting the approval process of MBSE models and documents are done using Express.js to the blockchain through smart contracts which we are simulating using PostgreSQL and Organization User credentials are stored in a local database (PostgreSQL) and approved MBSE assets are submitted to a control board for approval. The primary goal will be on the implementation of the MBSE Approval process, simulating the blockchain operations using PostgreSQL and differentiating the Local data vs Blockchain data.</p><br>
					2.	Security and Privacy Modeling (SPM) for Consortium Blockchain Using XACML/ALFA<br> <P>Abstract: The goal of this project is to use XACML/ALFA to specify the security and privacy requirements of two MBSE processes and implement them in Hyperledger’s Fabric, those are the MBSE approval process and the MBSE model collaboration process, which determines how different organizations collaborate on MBSE model development. The team needs to be familiar with XACML/ALFA and acquire the skills of specifying security attributes and policies. There are many features in blockchain applications that can be used to implement ABAC security policies. The focuses are on two aspects: Smart Contract (write simple SC enough to assure ABAC security) and MSP (configure organizations and users, and their attributes in Fabric’s MSP, set up the configuration files).</p><br>
